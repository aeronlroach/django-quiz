## Getting Started
### NOTE: If you have not used Django before I recommend you read the "First Steps" section of the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/) before using this package.

Clone the repo with
~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/aeronlroach/django-quiz.git
~~~~

Now install the requirements. This command should ensure all the libraries you need for this project are installed.
~~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~~

Now that Django is installed, you can start your Django project. Replace `project_name` with the name of your project. **NOTE: If already have a set up Django project, you can skip this step**
~~~~bash
django-admin startproject project_name
~~~~

Then run
~~~~bash
python setup.py install
~~~~

Add `"quizzes"` and `"nested_admin"` to your INSTALLED_APPS in your project's `settings.py`

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'quizzes',
        'nested_admin',
        ...
    )
    
Add the following to your project's `urls.py`

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include
    from quizzes.views import quiz_upload

    urlpatterns = [
        path('quizzes/', include('quizzes.urls')),
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('nested_admin/', include('nested_admin.urls')),
        path('upload-csv/', quiz_upload, name="quiz_upload"),
    ]

Now make your migrations and migrate your data with `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`

If you have not done so already, create a superuser account `python manage.py createsuperuser`and then check that the sever runs `python manage.py runserver`

Visit the local server at `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` to login and see the admin panel. After following the csv formatting instructions in [Making a Quiz](#making-a-quiz), visit `127.0.0.1:8000/upload-csv` to upload your quiz build csv. This process is discussed in detail [below](#uploading-a-quiz). If you receive an error trying to access `127.0.0.1:8000/upload-csv`, your admin session expired – so you will need to login again.

## Making a Quiz
It is recommended that you build a quiz using a csv file. While in-browser building is available, the relational linking must be completed manually. The csv method automates this process.

### CSV Formatting
The first line of the csv is formatted as follows. Replace `QUIZ NAME` with the name of your quiz, the date field with the current date, and `DESCRIPTION OF QUIZ` with brief description of your quiz **NOTE: As this is a csv, you must put you description in quotation marks if you are going to use commas in the description.** This line will establish the Quiz model. Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the date you are creating the quiz - follow the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
~~~~bash
QUIZ NAME,YYYY-MM-DD,DESCRIPTION OF QUIZ
~~~~

The rest of the csv follows this format.
~~~~bash
QUIZ NAME,CATEGORY 1 NAME,QUESTION 1 TEXT,ANSWER 1 TEXT,ANSWER WEIGHT,FEEDBACK TEXT FOR ANSWER 1
QUIZ NAME,CATEGORY 1 NAME,QUESTION 1 TEXT,ANSWER 2 TEXT,ANSWER WEIGHT,FEEDBACK TEXT FOR ANSWER 2
QUIZ NAME,CATEGORY 1 NAME ,QUESTION 1 TEXT,ANSWER 3 TEXT,ANSWER WEIGHT,FEEDBACK TEXT FOR ANSWER 3
~~~~
These three lines represent a category that has question with has three answer choices. Example CSV files can be found in the [Example CSV Files]() folder. **NOTE: As stated before, if you use commas the text for questions/answers/feedback, you must surround the text in qutation marks** This folder also contains a stock template of the following format:
* Quiz
  *  Category 1
      *  Question 1
          *  Answer 1 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 2 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 3 with Custom Feedback if Selected
      *  Question 2
          *  Answer 1 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 2 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 3 with Custom Feedback if Selected
  *  Category 2
      *  Question 1
          *  Answer 1 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 2 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 3 with Custom Feedback if Selected
      *  Question 2
          *  Answer 1 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 2 with Custom Feedback if Selected
          *  Answer 3 with Custom Feedback if Selected

### Uploading a Quiz
After following the csv formatting instructions above start the server with `python manage.py runserver`

Login at `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` and navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000/upload-csv`

From here, select `Browse...` and navigate to the directory where your quiz csv is stored, and select the csv.

Now press `Upload` and the page should refresh, if no error messages display - you have successfully built a quiz.

Navigating to `127.0.0.1:8000/quizzes` you should see the Title of the quiz on the quiz index. Your quiz is now stored in the database. Click `Info` to look at the Quiz detail view, or `Take Quiz` to start a quiz session

## Getting User Data
To export user data from the database, I recommend using [DB Browser for SQlite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) while I develop an in-browser export feature.
